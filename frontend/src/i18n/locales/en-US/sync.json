  "technicalDetails": "Technical Details",
  "rsyncUsage": "The tool uses rsync for file transfer, which is efficient and only transfers the changed parts of files.",
  "inotifyUsage": "inotify-tools (specifically inotifywait) is used to watch for file system events in real-time, enabling instant synchronization.",
  "fallbackMode": "If inotify-tools is not available, the tool falls back to periodic polling (checking for changes every few seconds), which is less efficient but still functional.",
  "helpIntro": "For optimal sync performance, install these packages on your remote server. The sync feature will still work without them (using SFTP fallback and polling), but performance and real-time detection will be degraded.",
  "rsyncDescription": "Without rsync, sync uses SFTP which transfers whole files instead of incremental diffs.",
